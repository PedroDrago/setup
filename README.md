## Kickstart
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y && sudo apt install git -y && git clone https://github.com/PedroDrago/setup.git $HOME/setup && cd $HOME/setup && bash ./main.sh
```


## To-do

- [ ] I guess the Ideal would be hosting a version in a URL where I could do `curl -LsSf https://drago.com/setup.sh | sh` instead of executing this blocks of bash.
- [ ] Fix cargo install eza and alacritty.
